# Future Steps

Track of pending work, ordered by priority.

## High Priority

### Import Pipeline Improvements

**Context:** The CSV import (`POST /api/players/import`) now handles Age and Role_M correctly. Mate field still stores player names (string) rather than IDs.

**Issues:**

| Field | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `Role_M` | **DONE** | Parsed from semicolon-separated CSV string to `List<string>`. Exposed in `PlayerReadDto`. |
| `Age` | **DONE** | Added to `PlayerCreateDto`, mapped through to `Player` entity. Exposed in `PlayerReadDto`. |
| `Mate` | Open | Stored as mate's **name** (string). Fragile: names are ambiguous ("Ederson D.s."), change over time. Consider storing as **player ID** (`MateId int?`) instead. |

**Mate detail:** Currently stored as player name string. Open question: should BE resolve names to IDs post-import (two-pass), or should ML output mate's SkyBet ID directly?

### Suggestion Engine — Completed Refactoring

**Context:** The suggestion engine (`POST /api/teams/getOptimal`) underwent a comprehensive refactoring to fix mathematical anomalies (negative deltas at market price) and improve architecture. Full writeup: [`docs/suggestion-engine-refactoring.md`](suggestion-engine-refactoring.md).

| Area | Item | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| **Math** | Budget double-counting fix | **DONE** |
| **Math** | Context-aware Stage 1 DP (forced player included in scoring) | **DONE** |
| **Math** | Performance-based starter selection (ExpectedPerformance, not cost) | **DONE** |
| **Arch** | Unified `ComputeSingleSuggestionAsync` pipeline | **DONE** |
| **Arch** | Concurrent twin-run via `Task.WhenAll` | **DONE** |
| **Arch** | `ScoringPlayer` record (MarketValue ≠ AcquisitionCost) | **DONE** |
| **Arch** | `ScoringEngine` extraction (static class) | **DONE** |
| **Arch** | DTO dual binding (`price` + `acquisitionPrice`) | **DONE** |
| **Quality** | O(1) DP lookups (`playerById` dict) | **DONE** |
| **Quality** | Structured logging (`ILogger`) | **DONE** |
| **Quality** | Dead code removal | **DONE** |

**Guarantees:**
- Market price bid → $\Delta = 0.00$
- Below-market bid → $\Delta > 0.00$
- Overpaying → $\Delta < 0.00$

### Suggestion Engine Caching

**Context:** The suggestion engine recomputes Stage 1 DP tables on every request (~1 MB, tens of ms). During live auctions, the frontend may fire rapid repeated calls with the same team state.

**What to do:** Add an in-process LRU cache keyed by a hash of `(teamId, availablePlayerIds, teamComposition)`. Cache the Stage 1 `RoleValueTable` results per role. Invalidate when the team changes (player added/removed). Small capacity (5 entries, ~5 MB max) is sufficient.

**Options:** `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory.MemoryCache` with size-based eviction, or a simple `ConcurrentDictionary` with manual LRU logic.

### Unit / Integration Tests

No tests exist yet. Priority areas:
- `TeamSuggestionService` scoring logic
- Mapper correctness (TeamMapper, LeagueMapper, TeamPlayerMapper, PlayerMapper)
- Controller endpoints

---

### Authentication Middleware

No auth is configured. Needed before exposing the API externally.

---

### Connection String Configuration

`appsettings.json` ships with an empty `DefaultConnection`. The local copy is set manually. Consider wiring it through environment variables (`Configuration["ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection"]`) so the committed file stays clean.

---

## Low Priority

### Unused Imports

`TeamSuggestionService.cs` imports `System.Reflection.Emit` and `System.Runtime.ConstrainedExecution` which appear unused.
